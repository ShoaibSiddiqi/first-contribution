<p style= "text-align:center;"> <i> <b> Assignment on Lorem Ipsum </b> </i> </p>
  <h2> What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
  <p> <i>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</i> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s.</p>
  <h3> Where does it come from? </h3>
  <p style="font-size:100%;"> Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of <q> <strong> <i>"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" </i> </strong></q>This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.(The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.The first line of Lorem Ipsum,
  <q> <strong> <i> de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum </i> </strong></q> , comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
  <h4> Why do we use it? </h4>
  <p> It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. <br> <i>The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.</i> </p>
<h5 style="font-size:90%;">Where can I get some?</h5>
<p style="text-align:center;"><q> <strong> There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. </strong></q> </p>
